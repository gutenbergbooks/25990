<h2><a name="FOREWORD" id="FOREWORD"></a>FOREWORD.</h2>


<p>Years ago a country boy heard or read that if a simple
box having a hole of a certain size were set upon a post in
March or early April it would not be long before bluebirds
would be around to see if the place would do as a summer cottage.
So he took an old paint keg such as white lead is sold
in, nailed a cover across the top, cut an opening in the side and
then placed it on a post ten or twelve feet high. Only a day
or two passed before a soft call-note was heard, a flash of blue,
and the songster had arrived. His mate came a few days later
and the paint keg with its tenants became the center of interest
in my life. A second brood was reared in midsummer and when
the cool days of September came a fine flock left for the South.
Each year the house was occupied until the post decayed and
the paint keg fell down, but in memory the sad call-note is still
heard when spring comes, for it is house hunting time once more,
and the bluebirds are looking for the home they had known.</p>

<p>That boys elsewhere may know the joy of the companionship
of birds, this little book is written. Birds will come and
live near the houses of men whenever food and water are to be
had, safety from enemies is given, and when homes are built for
them to replace the shelters nature offered before men came with
their cultivated fields and crowded cities. The following pages
give pictures and drawings of houses that boys have built and
in which birds have lived. These houses are planned for the
species of birds that have become accustomed to civilization so
that they will inhabit the houses put up for them.</p>

<p>The author is indebted to Professor Chas. A. Bennett of
Bradley Institute and Mr. L. L. Simpson of The Manual Arts
Press for helpful suggestions and encouragement; to John Friese
for making the drawings; and to the following for the use of
the originals of the illustrations which tell most of the story.</p>

<h2><a name="BIRDS_THAT_LIVE_IN_NESTING_BOXES" id="BIRDS_THAT_LIVE_IN_NESTING_BOXES"></a>BIRDS THAT LIVE IN NESTING BOXES.</h2>


<p>Certain varieties of birds will nest in homes built for them
if these houses are of the right shape and dimensions. Other
birds may be just as desirable but do not build nests and rear
their young in boy-made nesting boxes. We are therefore mainly
concerned with the first group which select cavities in trees
for their homes if nothing better is to be found.</p>

<span class="caption">FIG. 1. BLUE BIRDS, ADULTS AND YOUNG BIRD.</span><br /><br />
</p>


<h3><a name="BLUEBIRD" id="BLUEBIRD"></a>BLUEBIRD.</h3>

<p>This bird may be found during the summer months in most
of the states east of the Rocky Mountains, Figs. <a href="#fig_1_">1</a> and <a href="#fig_59">59</a>. It
spends its winter in the southern states and southward, returning
north in March and April. The principal items of food are
grasshoppers, caterpillars and beetles. It should have a house
measuring about 5" in length and width, inside measurements,
and 8" or more in depth. The entrance hole should be 1-1/2" in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
diameter and placed near the top, so that the young birds cannot
get out until strong enough to have some chance of escape
from their enemies after they leave the nest. While authorities
differ as to the need of cleaning after a season's use, it seems
wise to provide the house with some device whereby the bottom
may be removed for such purposes. Houses for this species are
shown in Figs. <a href="#fig_11">11</a>, <a href="#fig_21">21</a>, <a href="#fig_22">22</a> and <a href="#fig_24">24</a>.</p>

<span class="caption">FIG. 2.</span><br /><br />
</p>


<h3><a name="ROBIN" id="ROBIN"></a>ROBIN.</h3>

<p>Robins usually announce the coming of spring when they
return to their breeding grounds in the northern states, where
they are general favorites. Figs. <a href="#fig_2">2</a> and <a href="#fig_60">60</a>. The nest is usually
built of mud and lined with grasses; placed in the fork of a tree
or on some sheltered ledge. Robins take kindly to nesting shelves<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
put up for them and it is well to put up several since but
one brood is reared in each nest built. This old nest should be
removed after the young birds have gone. A simple shelf is
shown in the lower left hand corner of the photograph, Fig. <a href="#fig_24">24</a>,
as well as in Figs. <a href="#fig_20">20</a> and <a href="#fig_49">49</a>.</p>

<p class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a name="fig_3" id="fig_3"></a><img src="images/image003.jpg" width="400" height="580" alt="FIG. 3. (CHICKADEE)" title="FIG. 3." />
<span class="caption">FIG. 3.</span><br /><br />
</p>


<h3><a name="CHICKADEE" id="CHICKADEE"></a>CHICKADEE.</h3>

<p>The chickadee is one of the brave little spirits who spends
the entire winter with us, Fig. <a href="#fig_3">3</a>. We can be of considerable
service to him during the cold weather by providing food shelters.
During the summer months his home is usually found in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
some decaying stump, hence nesting boxes of the rustic type
placed in some remote spot of the orchard or park are most
attractive to him.</p>


<h3><a name="WREN" id="WREN"></a>WREN.</h3>

<p>When all other song birds fail to take advantage of a house
built for them, the wren may still be counted on. Almost any
sort of home from a tin can or hollow gourd on up is satisfactory
if put in a safe place and provided with an opening 1" or
slightly less in diameter, so the sparrows must stay out, Figs. <a href="#fig_4">4</a>
and <a href="#fig_5">5</a>. Good homes are shown in Figs. <a href="#fig_10">10</a>, <a href="#fig_14">14</a>, <a href="#fig_15">15</a>, <a href="#fig_16">16</a> and others.</p>

<span class="caption">FIG. 4. WREN AND RUSTIC HOUSE.</span><br /><br />
</p>


<h3><a name="HOUSE_FINCH" id="HOUSE_FINCH"></a>HOUSE FINCH.</h3>

<p>The house finch has made many enemies because of its fondness
for cultivated fruits and berries. However, it has some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
redeeming features in its song and beauty. The nest is usually
placed in the fork of a limb&mdash;evergreens being favorite nesting
places. The house shown in Fig. <a href="#fig_51">51</a> is suitable for these birds
but is also acceptable to wrens.</p>

<span class="caption">FIG. 6. FLICKER.</span><br /><br />
</p>


<h3><a name="WOODPECKER" id="WOODPECKER"></a>WOODPECKER.</h3>

<p>The favorite of this interesting family is the little downy,
Fig. <a href="#fig_7">7</a>. Living largely upon harmful grubs and insects, this bird
does an immense amount of good by protecting our forests from
insect scourges. Woodpeckers do not build nests as most birds
do, but excavate a deep cavity in some dead tree leaving a quantity
of chips at the bottom on which the eggs are laid. Nesting
boxes should be of the rustic type made as shown in Fig. <a href="#fig_12">12</a>,
leaving some sawdust mixed with a little earth in the cavity.
These houses should be placed on trees in a park or orchard.
Boys should be able to tell the difference between the woodpeckers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
beneficial to man and the sapsucker whose misdeeds often
cause considerable damage to fruit trees. A nuthatch is also
seen in Fig. <a href="#fig_7">7</a> enjoying a meal of sunflower seed.</p>

</p>


<h3><a name="FLICKER" id="FLICKER"></a>FLICKER.</h3>

<p>The flickers spend much of their time on the ground in
search of ants which form the larger percentage of their food.
Since ants sometimes cause considerable trouble for other birds,
a pair of flickers are worth cultivating for the sake of the work<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
they can do. Artificial nesting boxes of sufficient depth and size
are quite readily used, Figs. <a href="#fig_6">6</a>, <a href="#fig_20">20</a> and <a href="#fig_25">25</a>.</p>


<h3><a name="MARTIN" id="MARTIN"></a>MARTIN.</h3>

<p>Nearly everyone knows swallows of one variety or another.
The most beautiful of the family are the martins, Fig. <a href="#fig_8">8</a>. This
bird is of great service against the inroads of wasps, bugs and
beetles. It prefers to live in colonies even though the males fight
bitterly at times. Martin houses should have at least several
rooms, each separate from all the others. Houses have been built
to accommodate fifty and more families. Smaller ones are shown
in Figs. <a href="#fig_8">8</a>, <a href="#fig_9">9</a>, <a href="#fig_13">13</a> and <a href="#fig_45">45</a>.</p>

</p>

<p>Fig. <a href="#fig_9">9</a> is a miniature reproduction of Peer Gynt's cottage for a martin
house. This house was not only an attractive thing to make, but martins
selected it for their home during the past summer.</p>

<h2><a name="CONSTRUCTION_OF_BIRD_HOUSES" id="CONSTRUCTION_OF_BIRD_HOUSES"></a>CONSTRUCTION OF BIRD HOUSES.</h2>


<p>Bird houses may be divided into three main classes: (1)
those made of sawed lumber to specified dimensions; (2) the rustic
type made of (a) slabs of wood with the bark left on, or (b)
pieces of tree trunk, or (c) of sawed lumber trimmed with bark
or twigs; and (3) cement or stucco houses. In each case the
entrance should slant slightly upward to keep the rain out.</p>

<p class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a name="fig_10" id="fig_10"></a><img src="images/image010.jpg" width="600" height="346" alt="FIG. 10. WREN HOUSES." title="FIG. 10. WREN HOUSES." />
<span class="caption">FIG. 10. WREN HOUSES.</span><br /><br />
</p>

<p>Almost any sort of lumber may be used, but birds take most
readily to that which has been weathered out of doors. A kind
should be used which does not warp or check badly; white pine
and cypress meet these requirements and are worked with ease.
Yellow poplar is used and cedar with or without the bark left
on has its friends for houses of the first or second classes.</p>

<p>Nesting boxes of sawed lumber should be painted on the
outside to improve their appearance and to preserve them against
the effect of the weather. It is often wise to leave a small amount
of unpainted surface around the entrance, and all paint should be
thoroughly dry before houses are expected to be occupied. Colors
selected will depend somewhat upon the neighborhood, but white,
grey, dull greens or browns are often used.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>
<h3>DIMENSIONS OF NESTING BOXES.</h3>

<p>The following table, copied from Farmers Bulletin, No. 609,
U. S. Dept. of Agriculture, gives in small space valuable information
about dimensions that experience and investigation have
indicated as good for particular varieties of birds. This list includes
many varieties that do not commonly live in houses built
for them, however. As time goes on, we may expect to find more
of these birds living in our nesting boxes because they are apt
to seek the same sort of home as the one in which they were
reared. The table is given to be of service to those wishing to
plan new houses not shown here.</p>

<h3><a name="HOUSES_OF_SAWED_LUMBER" id="HOUSES_OF_SAWED_LUMBER"></a>HOUSES OF SAWED LUMBER.</h3>

<p>The boy with an outfit of tools at home, or with a teacher
of manual training interested in birds, can make all of the houses
to be described in this section. Figs. <a href="#fig_10">10</a> and <a href="#fig_11">11</a> show simple
houses for wrens and bluebirds. Drawings for this type of house<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
are shown in Figs. <a href="#fig_14">14</a>, <a href="#fig_15">15</a> and <a href="#fig_21">21</a>. While the surfaces of lumber
used for these houses may or may not be planed, care must be
taken that all pieces are sawed or planed to the correct sizes with
edges and ends square and true so there will be no bad cracks for
drafts and rain to enter. Be careful to nail the pieces together
so that they will not have occasion to crack or warp. A good way
to save time and lumber is to prepare a piece of stock, getting it
of the right thickness, width and length, and then to saw up
this stock on lines carefully laid out as shown in the drawings
of the bluebird and wren houses, flicker nest, robin shelf and
finch house. The most difficult houses to build are those for
martins. In Fig. <a href="#fig_45">45</a> is given a drawing for a small home arranged
to care for eight families, while the photographs, Figs. <a href="#fig_8">8</a>,
<a href="#fig_9">9,</a> <a href="#fig_38">38</a>, <a href="#fig_66">66</a> and <a href="#fig_67">67</a> show larger, finer and more difficult houses. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
doors or openings are 2-1/2" in diameter and can be made with
an expansion bit or a key-hole saw. All of these houses are to
be made so they may be cleaned. Sometimes the bottom is hinged
on two screws or nails, and held in proper place by a dowel
(bluebird house, Fig. <a href="#fig_21">21</a>); or screwed in place (wren house, Fig.
<a href="#fig_21">21,</a> and martin house, Fig. <a href="#fig_45">45</a>); or hinged and held in place by
a brass spring (wren house, Fig. <a href="#fig_14">14</a>).</p>

<span class="caption">FIG. 12. RUSTIC HOUSES.</span><br /><br />
</p>


<h3>RUSTIC HOUSES.</h3>

<p>The first group of houses of this type are shown in Figs. <a href="#fig_12">12</a>,
<a href="#fig_35">35</a> and <a href="#fig_36">36</a>. These are made of slabs of wood with the bark left
on, and in some cases, of the bark alone if it can be secured of
sufficient thickness. It is usually a good plan to drive a sufficient
number of nails into the bark to keep it in place, otherwise it
will drop off. Houses such as these attract birds that would
avoid a freshly painted imitation of some large residence or public
building. Figs. <a href="#fig_20">20</a> and <a href="#fig_37">37</a> show houses made of a section of a
tree split or sawed in halves, the nest cavity hollowed out, and
then fastened together again with screws. The top should be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
covered with a board or piece of tin to keep out rain. The third
division of this type of house is made of sawed lumber and then
trimmed with bark or twigs. In this way the same frames may
be made to appear as very different bird houses when completed.
Such houses are shown in Figs. <a href="#fig_30">30</a> to <a href="#fig_34">34</a>. Sometimes a pail is
used for the frame and then covered with bark, as the center
house of Fig. <a href="#fig_28">28</a>. This house has a partition placed half-way
up making it a two family apartment, and is provided with ventilating
and cleaning devices.</p>


<h3>CEMENT AND STUCCO HOUSES.</h3>

<p>Houses may be cast of concrete
as Fig. <a href="#fig_39">39</a>. This requires
a mold or form, and takes considerable
planning to insure success.
A form is made whose inside
dimensions are those of the
outside of the bird house, and of
the desired shape. A second
form, or core, to be placed inside
of the first form, is made as large
as the inside of the bird house.
The two forms must be mounted
so they will remain in the
right relation while concrete is
placed in the space between
them. After this has set, the forms may be removed, cleaned and
used again. The roof is generally made separately and put in
position last. Or the roof can be cast as a part of the house in
which case the bottom is inserted last. Birds do not take as
kindly to this type of house as a rule, as to those made of wood.</p>

<span class="caption">FIG. 13. STUCCO HOUSE FOR MARTINS.</span><br /><br />
</p>

<p>The stucco house has many possibilities. Fig. <a href="#fig_38">38</a>, shows a
group of such houses designed to match the general appearance
of garages in good residence districts. The frame is made
of wood and t Pg020 co applied by one of the methods in use on
large houses. Seventh grade boys have made such houses, using
3/8" material for the frames, tacking on wire netting and then
plastering each side of the house in turn with concrete. The
sides were given a pebble-dash surface, while the roof was finished
with a steel trowel to give a smooth surface that will shed
water readily, Fig. <a href="#fig_13">13</a>.</p>

<p>The table given on page <a href="#Page_16">16</a> states the height from the ground
that different species of birds seem to prefer for their nests, to
which several suggestions may be added. The houses should be
so located that cats and other bird enemies do not have easy access
to them. The openings ought to be turned away from the
directions from which storms and winds most often come; and
the house must hang or tilt so rain does not run in at the entrance.
Such birds as the woodpeckers spend most of their time<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
in the trees and so do not take as readily to a house set on a pole
out in the open as martins or bluebirds. Flickers are seen on the
ground a good share of the time in search of their favorite food,
and so will frequently live in houses nailed to fence posts.
Houses are more apt to be occupied if placed in position in fall or
winter before the spring migration, especially houses made of
freshly dressed or newly painted wood. However, such birds as
the robin and bluebird rear more than one brood each season and
so a house set up in May or June may have a tenant. Figs. <a href="#fig_40">40</a>

<p>Nesting boxes make their appeal to but a part of the birds
of any community. These attract during the early spring and
summer months. Many other species are worth having in our
orchards and gardens for their songs and their activity in destroying
insects and weed seeds. To these some other attraction<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
than nesting boxes must be offered. Then again, many birds
would spend a longer time with us if a certain food supply were
assured them. A simple suet feeder is shown in Fig. <a href="#fig_45">45</a>. The
birds cling to the chicken wire while eating. A feeding box for
seed-eating birds is given in Fig. <a href="#fig_46">46</a>. Fig. <a href="#fig_47">47</a> gives a shelf to
be nailed to the sunny side of a building, while Fig. <a href="#fig_48">48</a> shows a
somewhat similar type to be fastened to a window sill, making
it possible to observe the birds that come to dine. Birds that
hesitate to come close to buildings may be attracted by the feeders
set out in the open. Fig. <a href="#fig_50">50</a> shows a feeder mounted on an
iron pipe so it can be turned in any direction. This feeder has
one end closed by a pane of glass, and is to be turned so that
prevailing winds do not enter. Fig. <a href="#fig_49">49</a> shows a feeding shelf for
winter use which makes an acceptable robin nesting shelf in
spring. In Fig. <a href="#fig_53">53</a> is given a feeder mounted on a base with a
vane so the adjustment takes place automatically. Figs. <a href="#fig_51">51</a> and
<a href="#fig_52">52</a> show two food shelters considerably more difficult to construct.
They have glass on all sides, and are open at the bottom so that
birds can enter or leave at will. Fig. <a href="#fig_30">30</a> shows a simple food
shelter offering some protection against rain and snow, while a
very attractive group of shelters are given in Figs. <a href="#fig_54">54</a>, <a href="#fig_55">55</a>, <a href="#fig_56">56</a> and
<a href="#fig_57">57</a>. If you look closely you may see "Mabel" in the right hand
feeder in Fig. <a href="#fig_54">54</a>. The builder of these shelters found her so
positive about her rights&mdash;since she discovered the food supply&mdash;that
he has been obliged to put up the others to keep peace.</p>

<p>The window-sill lunch counter shown in Figs. <a href="#fig_58">58</a> and <a href="#fig_61">61</a> is
a most effective way to study birds at close range. The window
selected for this purpose should be on a quiet and sheltered side
of the house if possible. If trees and shrubbery are near at hand
birds are more likely to be attracted. Branches of thorn apples,
alders and evergreens are fastened firmly to the window frames
to dress the lunch counter on the outside while house plants or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>

<h3><a name="FOODS" id="FOODS"></a>FOODS.</h3>

<p>Food shelters become centers of interest in proportion to
the number of birds attracted to them. The kind of food placed
there determines in time the kind of birds that will be found frequenting
them. Seed-eating birds are readily attracted by the
use of small grains such as oats and wheat. However, every<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
farmer finds a quantity of weed seeds upon cleaning his seed
grain, which proves very acceptable to chickadees and blue jays.
Bread crusts or crumbs, crackers and doughnuts may be placed
in the food shelter with the knowledge that the birds will eat
them. For those of the city who would need to buy seeds, it will
be just as well to get hemp, millet, canary seed and sunflower<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
seed, together with the small grains and cracked corn for
foods. Suet, scraps of meat and various vegetable scraps, such as
celery, lettuce, apples, raisins, and the berries of various bushes,
if they can be obtained, are relished. Bluebirds seem fond of
meal worms such as develop in old cereals. All birds require water
and frequently suffer because this is not to be had. If it is
possible to meet this need a great service is rendered. Finally,
when the ground is snow covered, many birds appreciate a supply
of sand and finely ground poultry grit. Many birds are lost
each winter because of insufficient food during inclement weather,
that if cared for would remain near neighbors in the summer
to wage war upon insect pests.</p>

<p>Fig. <a href="#fig_62">62</a> shows several baths made of concrete. The pedestal
and basin are made of two separate pieces, and are cast in a form
or mold. A more difficult concrete bath is shown in Fig. <a href="#fig_63">63</a>. This
project is made in four pieces. The base consists of two parts,
the bottom being cast in a form made of 1/2" or 7/8" stock. The
upper part is "swept up" by means of the templet shown, which
revolves about an iron rod or a dowel-rod firmly fastened above,
and held below in a hole bored in a temporary base of wood. The
column is cast in a mold made of sheet tin or galvanized iron run
thru tinners' rolls, and held by means of several wires twisted
about it. When this is being cast two pieces of iron rod are inserted
as shown which are to pass into both bowl and base to
make the whole job firm. The bowl may be swept by either of
two methods. The first consists of the making of two templets.
With the first templet a core of clay is swept up of the desired
depth and diameter. Then concrete is placed over this core,
which has previously been treated to a coat of oil. Woven wire
is cut into a circular shape and bent to approximate the curve
of the bowl. More concrete is placed over this, and swept up by
means of the second templet. Some difficulty will be experienced
in removing the templet if undercut as much as shown; however,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
the mark where it was taken off can easily be troweled smooth
again. The finished pieces are now assembled with a small quantity
of "neat" cement in each joint. The second method for
making the bowl begins with the making of templets cut on the
opposite side of the outline, as compared with the first method. A
box is then nailed up and a clay or plaster-of-paris base made.
This is oiled, and the concrete put in place. In this case a wetter
mixture than in the first case should be used. The second templet
is then used to strike off the inside of the bowl. After this has
set the pieces may be assembled as before.</p>

<h2><a name="BIRD_ENEMIES" id="BIRD_ENEMIES"></a>BIRD ENEMIES.</h2>


<p>One sometimes wonders that birds manage to exist and to
actually increase in numbers. Possibly the first group of enemies
should include men and boys who kill adult birds, leaving the
fledglings to starve, or who rob the nests of eggs. It is the writer's
belief that every boy who makes one or more of the projects
in this booklet, and sees it occupied, will become one of a growing
number who will care for instead of destroy the birds of his
neighborhood. Further, if every man who now thoughtlessly or
willfully destroys birds, knew the real money value of the work
birds do, he would build or buy houses and food shelters to increase
Nature's best friends to mankind.</p>

<p>The second group of enemies include ants and other vermin
which at times infest nests and nesting boxes, snakes, squirrels,
mice and rats. Protection against this group is afforded by bands
of tin about the pole, or spikes of wood or metal pointing downward
so that access is impossible by climbing up the pole. Another
protection is to make the entrance holes small enough to
admit only the occupant for whom the house was intended. Of
course, the houses for the larger birds must be protected in other
ways. Charles Tesch of Milwaukee suggests a sticky fly paper
compound made of resin (melted) and castor oil as a preventive
for the inroads of the small red ant, if suitable support is available.</p>

<p>The final group consists of the two worst foes of bird life,
cats and English or house sparrows. If you really value the
birds that have been reared in the house you have built you may
need to get up <i>early</i> more than one morning when the youngsters<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
leave the nest to protect them from the highly respectable (?)
tabby that lives possibly next door if not at your own house. It
often comes to a choice between cats and birds: and the cats may
be disposed of in two ways&mdash;the right kind of box traps for the
homeless and unknown robbers, and an air rifle with sufficient
"sting" for the trespasser from next door. A few lessons of this
kind usually have some effect.</p>

<p>The English or house sparrow was introduced into this country
about a half-century ago. It has spread over practically all
of the United States and Southern Canada. Possibly no bird has
exhibited such powers of adapting itself to new conditions. The
sparrow is no respecter of places for locating its nest. It lives on
a variety of foods changing from one to another as the necessity
arises. In spite of opposition, this bird is constantly on the increase,
so much so that in many cases more desirable native birds
have been obliged to leave. The sparrow is filthy and quarrelsome,
and lives mainly upon valuable small grains in every case
where this is possible. There are two methods possible which afford
partial relief: (1) traps and (2) driving them away with
an air-rifle. Traps are usually successful for a comparatively
brief time, since the sparrows soon associate the trap with danger
and so avoid it. A very successful type of woven wire trap is advocated
by the Department of Agriculture but is probably beyond
the ability of the average boy to make well. It sells by commercial
manufacturers of bird supplies for about $4.00. This trap
works all the year around as it depends upon the attraction of
food. Fig. <a href="#fig_65">65</a> gives a simple, yet effective trap. However, it requires
the presence of some hidden observer to spring it at the
right moment. Another type of trap is based upon the nest-house
idea. Its effectiveness is limited largely to the nesting season,
though it may be used by the birds for shelter. One of the most
efficient traps was invented by Charles Tesch, of Milwaukee, Wis.
Its principle is that of a tipping chamber leading into a sack
thru a chute. Fig. <a href="#fig_64">64</a> gives the dimensions to be followed in
making such a trap. The inventor says that the bag should be
far enough away from the box to make certain that the victim
has no chance to tell the others what happened to him by chirping,
otherwise they will no longer enter the trap. The box must
be perfectly tight in order to prevent drafts from issuing thru
the entrance which will cause sparrows to keep away. If a few
feathers are glued or shellacked to the tipping chamber floor, the
sparrow is often attracted more strongly. The bag should be
examined frequently to liberate bluebirds and wrens, who may
have been caught.</p>

<p>However, fighting bird enemies without the cooperation of
neighbors is not an easy matter. In the case of sparrows, so
many more are left that traps alone are ineffective. An airgun
properly used offers some help in the city to drive them away
from the premises, while a shot gun or 22 caliber rifle are more
effective in the country. If every sparrow nest were torn down
and no place given them in your neighborhood, the pest is likely
to avoid your grounds. Finally, keep nesting boxes free from
sparrows while the owners are away for the winter.</p>

<h2><a name="BIRD_HOUSE_EXHIBITIONS" id="BIRD_HOUSE_EXHIBITIONS"></a>BIRD HOUSE EXHIBITIONS.</h2>


<p>Many cities are beginning to do excellent work along the
lines of bird preservation and attraction. This usually leads
into an exhibition or contest, though many times quantities of
houses are made and sold for other purposes, such as raising
money for athletic suits for the school teams.</p>

<p>At Cleveland, Ohio, a large number of houses such as are
shown in Figs. <a href="#fig_15">15</a>-<a href="#fig_19">19</a> were made for the city Bird Lovers' Association
to be placed in the city parks. The boys received the
profits of the sale after materials were paid for. In the Mercer
Center, Seattle, Wash., the boys wanted suits for the "team."
Bird houses were made in dozen lots for a large department store,
and soon the boys had all the money the suits cost. Fig. <a href="#fig_36">36</a> shows
a group of 7th grade boys with the houses made in two class
periods of two hours each. At St. Paul, Minn., the annual exhibit
has become a larger affair than the automobile show. This
year it will be held in the city auditorium which seats 10,000
people. The city council will pay the rent of this building for
a week and the boys will see that it is filled with bird houses.
Up to date (March 11, 1916) over $1,000 worth of orders have
been taken for houses to be delivered after the exhibition. Fig. <a href="#fig_62">62</a>
shows the palm room at the St. Paul exhibit in 1915. The county
making the most bird houses in 1915, so far as has been reported,
was Allegheny County, Pa., where approximately 15,000 houses
were produced. Fig. <a href="#fig_67">67</a> shows the prize winners in a department
store contest at Pittsburgh, Pa., while an exhibit in the same city
is shown in Fig. <a href="#fig_66">66</a>.</p>

<p>Space will not permit giving extended rules for such contests
since the rules must vary with each city. Briefly, there
should be provision made to give all competitors an equal chance.
Boys of the 6th grade should meet others of that grade.
Prizes may be awarded for the best houses made for the more
common birds, such as wrens, bluebirds, and martins. These<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
should be judged as to adaptability or fitness to purpose, amount
of protection afforded to birds, good workmanship and artistic
merit. A prize might be awarded to the boy whose house has the
first pair of birds nesting in it. Prizes may be of many kinds,
but tools and books, as well as cash prizes are often given by
local business men.</p>
